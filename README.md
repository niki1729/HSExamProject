USEFULAPP

I do this Project for Highschool computer science final test, it's only for the Exam, the more developed App will be in https://github.com/niki1729/UsefullApp/
This App will have different features accessible by the ContentNavigationDrawer.
The App has a simple calculator (the eval process is written by me, I use the postfix form to calculate the expression), also the App has an Demoscreen with few random pictures
In the future I will implement other things.

I use labels.py to change faster the language I use, I only need to change there and I don't need to go throw all the text places.
